#Machine Learning Projects
This repository contains three machine learning projects I have worked on, focusing on different classification tasks: Spam SMS Recognition, Fraud Credit Card Transactions Detection, and Customer Churn Prediction. Each project uses various classifiers such as Logistic Regression, SVM, Naive Bayes, and Random Forest.

#Projects Overview:
1. Spam SMS Recognition
This project aims to classify SMS messages as spam or legitimate (ham). The dataset used contains a collection of SMS messages labeled accordingly. The main goal is to develop a model that can accurately identify spam messages using text classification techniques.

Key Features:
Text preprocessing (tokenization, stopwords removal, etc.)
Feature extraction using TF-IDF
Model training with Logistic Regression, SVM, Naive Bayes, and Random Forest
Performance evaluation using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
Usage:
Navigate to the spam_sms_recognition directory
Run the Jupyter notebook or the Python script to preprocess data, train models, and evaluate performance
2. Fraud Credit Card Transactions Detection
This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions. The dataset includes transactions with labels indicating whether a transaction is fraudulent. The objective is to build a model that can effectively identify fraudulent transactions to prevent financial losses.

Key Features:
Data preprocessing and handling of imbalanced classes
Feature engineering and selection
Model training with Logistic Regression, SVM, Naive Bayes, and Random Forest
Performance evaluation using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
Usage:
Navigate to the fraud_credit_card_detection directory
Run the Jupyter notebook or the Python script to preprocess data, train models, and evaluate performance
3. Customer Churn Prediction
This project aims to predict whether a customer will churn based on their interaction and transaction history. The dataset includes customer information and their churn status. The goal is to build a model that can predict customer churn, enabling proactive retention strategies.

Key Features:
Data preprocessing and handling of missing values
Feature engineering and selection
Model training with Logistic Regression, SVM, Naive Bayes, and Random Forest
Performance evaluation using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
Usage:
Navigate to the customer_churn_prediction directory
Run the Jupyter notebook or the Python script to preprocess data, train models, and evaluate performance
